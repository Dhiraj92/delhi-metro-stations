delhi-metro-stations
====================

A script to parse details of stations from wikipedia and a json file with coordinates of the stations.

The parser will only parse small details like name, line and layout of the station. If you
want to get more details from the page feel free to modify it.

**The metro.json in the root folder contains the coordinates of the stations as well.**
If you want to add more stations run the parser and add the coordinates to the metro.json
file and replace the json file in the root folder and send me a pull request.
